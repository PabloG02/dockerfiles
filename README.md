# Phenotypic Evolution Group Dockerfiles [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=docker&theme=light)](https://hub.docker.com/u/pegi3s)

This repository contains Dockerfiles for the images maintained by the [Phenotypic Evolution Group](http://www.i3s.up.pt/research-groups/neurobiology-and-neurologic-disorders/phenotypic-evolution) at the [Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology](https://www.ibmc.up.pt/) / [Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde da Universidade do Porto](https://www.i3s.up.pt/). All images are available through our [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/pegi3s/). If there is not a Dockerfile tab on an image repository just add "dockerfile" to the end of the Docker image URL.

In addition, this repository also contains tutorials to serve as guidance on the usage of existing Docker images (e. g. Trinity for RNA-Seq).
