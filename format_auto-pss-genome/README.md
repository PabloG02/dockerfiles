## (Please note that the original software licenses still apply)

This image facilitates the preparation of tar.gz file(s) from the project folders generated by auto-pss-genome (see pegi3s/auto-pss-genome) for submission to the [B+ database](http://bpositive.i3s.up.pt/).

# Using the format_auto-pss-genome image in Linux

You should adapt and run the following command: 
`docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /your/data/dir:/data pegi3s/format_auto-pss-genome /opt/bpos_option /your/data/dir`

In this command, you should replace:
- `/your/data/dir` to point to the working directory where the "ipssa_project" folder and the "ipssa-project.params" are located (appears twice).
- `bpos_option` to either `bpos_codeml.sh`, `bpos_fubar.sh` or `bpos_omegamap.sh` depending on whether you want to prepare codeML, FUBAR or Omegamap projects for submission to B+. 

Depending on the selected option a folder named either `codeml_projects`, `fubar_projects` or `omegamap_projects` will be created, containing the tar.gz file(s) ready to be submitted to B+.
